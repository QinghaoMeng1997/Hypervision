## 🚀 Quick Start
## 1. System requirements

### 1.1 All software dependencies and operating systems

The project has been tested on Windows 10 or Ubuntu 20.04.1.

### 1.2 Versions the software has been tested on

The project has been tested on CUDA 12.4, pytorch 2.4.1, torchvision 0.19.1,  python 3.8.20, opencv-python 4.11.0.86. 



## 2. Installation guide

- The code for training and testing can be downloaded at public repository ：https://github.com/QinghaoMeng1997/Hypervision  
- Due to the massive amount of training dataset, we have packaged it into multiple repositories for storage: https://github.com/bianlab/Hyperspectral-imaging-datase
